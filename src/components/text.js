    description:"I have a Bachelor degree in Informatics from Universidad Nacional de la Patagonia San Juan Bosco (2015). Currently, I’m pursuing a PhD in Engineering at UTN Buenos Aires. My research focus is the development of efficient algorithms for phenotype-genotype association, and se- veral applications in 3D morphometric reconstruction, medicine, and forensic science. I’m a member of the Patagonian Institute of Social and Human Sciences (IPCSH) and the Human Biology Research Group (GIBEH). GIBEH is concerned with the genetic and environ- mental basis and evolution of craniofacial structures in hominids, using this evidence to shed light on the human settlement of the New World, and on the modern Latin-American popula- tion. In this context, we focus on patterns of morphological integration in the hominid skull and modern faces, using concepts from Evo-Devo and Quantitative Genetics. Also, I’m a core developer for the 3D Lab project, a 3D scanner software for the remote analysis and diagnosis of obesity and overweight."
